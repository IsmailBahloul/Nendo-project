        Most men go through life by just winging it. They have a dream, but they
        don’t have a plan that guides them to live more efficiently and
        effectively. My consulting service is about developing your mindset to
        live your life effectively. This will lead to a more fulfilling life.
        The reality is that you have been sold lies your entire life. These lies
        have a direct influence on the actions you take in the world. It is now
        time that you take control back and live your true purpose.

        You will receive one-on-one consulting/coaching with me. You're going to
        feel emotion, a beautiful thing and making sure that you correctly use
        those emotions. Do not ever let how they make you feel stop you from
        doing what you're supposed to be doing. I will guide you to view the
        world differently with a mind that has broken free from the
        preconditioned effects of outside influences. Absolutely everything
        starts from your thoughts. The thoughts you have directly influence the
        actions you take within the world.

        Abdullah: No excuses, no days off. In just 2 sessions, I got insights
        into my own psychology and mind that I wasn't aware of. The perspective
        lent by Hamza was out of this world. To the people who lack motivation
        will not require motivation anymore. Once you apply the methods from the
        program, you'll be a beast who'll get rid of the pain of being normal. I
        applied it. From being a lazy, lost boy, I'm now building my own
        business, getting fit and connecting well. All thanks to the G, Hamza.

        You stop going to the gym after a few weeks and cannot find the
        motivation to do what needs to be done because you let your feelings
        affect you, and sometimes you have to do the complete opposite of how
        you feel. You're very rarely going to feel like working hard constantly
        doing what's right. You're not always going to be motivated. The idea
        that you need constant motivation shows the weakness in your mindset. My
        services will teach you how to put together an attitude that allows you
        to get things done. A perspective that prevents you from losing because
        if you have a mindset that doesn't allow you to lose, then you're simply
        going to win. There's no other option. You won't let anything hold you
        back from becoming GREATNESS. That mindset is the "No Excuses - No Days
        Off" mindset.

        You're not lazy. You’re conditioned to be lazy. You're not weak. You’re
        conditioned to be weak. You're not dumb. You’re conditioned to be dumb.
        As men, your entire life, you have been conditioned and programmed by
        your surroundings, which act against man's actual value and purpose in
        this life.Condition yourself to become a modern beast or get conditioned
        by society to be a weakling.

        As the world continues to fall into chaos and society is spiralling out

        end, which is why the need to revive this is of utmost urgency you have
        to act now not just for yourself but for your future generation and the
        society that they will grow up in.

        Let me tell you. I've been in your exact position before, stressed out
        all the time, doubting myself constantly, depression, anxiety, the
        feeling of not belonging, feeling of being lost conditioned by your
        every surrounding. However, here I am today, unshakable. I made it
        through. I don't need motivation to workout. I cannot want to with every
        fibre in my being, but I will still get it done. I use my mind, and I
        logically decide what I will do with my day regardless of how I feel,
        and I can guide you to this as well, so you don't have to make the same
        mistakes I made or take as long as I did. Your time is valuable. An
        intelligent man learns from his experiences, but a wise man learns from
        the experiences of others.

        With The No Excuses - No Days Off mindset, there will always be success
        and failure. For success to exist, there has to be failure. There's no
        way to have one without the other. You cannot have success without
        failure, and if you understand that you're failing, depressed, anxious
        and stressed, it’s because you're destined for greatness. Your failures
        start to make sense. Now you can feel sorry for yourself or take on the
        challenge and accept that your life will be challenging because you're a
        man. It's going to be difficult with all the tests and trials that come
        with failure. Still, you know you have to have no excuses, no days off,
        and have to be consistent to be someone. Remember, if you're struggling,
        you're struggling for an important reason. Now you need to know how to
        handle these situations because it will decide the kind of man you are
        going to become. A success or a failure.
